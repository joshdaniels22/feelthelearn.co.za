      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Feel the Learn! Founded by two dedicated University of Cape
        Town students, our mission is to transform the way mathematics is
        learned and understood. With over 5 years of tutoring experience, our
        founder brings a wealth of knowledge to our team.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Feel The Learn, we specialize in mathematics because we believe it's
        a subject that requires careful and thoughtful teaching. We prioritize
        building a strong foundation of fundamental concepts and understanding
        rather than rote memorization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team of tutors consists of current university students pursuing a
        range of degrees, ensuring they remain deeply immersed in the world of
        learning. With previous tutoring experience and exceptional academic
        achievements, our tutors are committed to helping students unlock their
        full potential in mathematics. Join us on a journey to master math
        through comprehensive understanding, and let us guide you towards
        success!

      <h2>Pricing</h2>
      <p>
        At Feel the Learn, we offer pricing that's not only competitive but also
        provides exceptional value for your math learning needs:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <b>Two-Hour Sessions:</b> We understand that one hour can sometimes be
          too short to dive deep into the complexities of mathematics. That's
          why we exclusively offer two-hour tutoring sessions, ensuring ample
          time for comprehensive learning and problem-solving.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
          <b>Session Rate:</b> Our pricing is straightforward and competitive.
          We charge R250 per hour, totaling R500 for a two-hour session to
          provide you with the best value for your investment in your education.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Travel Fee (if applicable):</b> For students residing outside the
          main Cape Town area, a nominal petrol/travel fee may apply. This fee
          helps compensate our dedicated tutors for their travel time and
          expenses while ensuring that quality tutoring is accessible to
          everyone.
